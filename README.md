# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Cameron Booth and I live in Chandler, Arizona, but I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. I moved to the Phoenix area a little over two years ago with my partner, Aleyna.

In my free time, I love to do anything creative. I am an avid muscisian and also like to dabble in painting and sewing.
